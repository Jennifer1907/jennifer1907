excerpt: "The honest story of my journey from Capital One intern to Senior Analyst at Stripe—including the mistakes, the pivots, and what actually moved the needle."
---

Five years ago I was a nervous intern at Capital One, trying to figure out how `JOIN` worked in SQL. Today I'm a Senior Data Analyst at Stripe, leading a team and presenting to VPs. Here's what actually moved the needle—and what I wasted time on.

## What I Got Right

### 1. I learned to communicate before I learned to model

The single biggest separator between mid-level and senior analysts isn't technical skill—it's the ability to translate a complex finding into a clear business recommendation.

Early in my career I gave an 18-slide deck full of confidence intervals to a VP who wanted to know: *should we expand to the UK market?* He stopped me after slide 3.

I rebuilt the presentation as: problem → recommendation → evidence. Three slides. He approved the project.

> *The goal of analysis is a decision, not a deliverable.*

### 2. I picked depth over breadth in my second year

The temptation as a new analyst is to learn everything: SQL, Python, R, Tableau, Power BI, Spark, Looker, dbt...

I got much more value from going deep on Python + SQL + one BI tool than from being mediocre at everything. When you're the team's Python expert, people come to you. When you're "okay at everything," people go to the specialist.

### 3. I got close to a domain

At Shopify I specialised in merchant health. I became the person who understood churn inside out—not just the models, but *why* merchants leave, what interventions work, what the product team was trying to do. That context made my analysis 10x more useful than technically superior work done without it.

### 4. I built in public (sort of)

Writing internal write-ups of my analyses, sharing findings in Slack, volunteering to present at data team all-hands—all of these compounded my visibility over time. People outside my immediate team started tagging me when they had data questions.

## What I Wasted Time On

### Chasing certifications before building projects

I spent three months of evenings on a cloud certification that nobody has ever asked me about in an interview. The project I built the month after that—a churn model for a nonprofit using Kaggle data—came up in every subsequent conversation.

Build things. Then document them. The certification is the resume line; the project is the interview.

### Perfecting analyses nobody read

I once spent two weeks refining a segmentation model. By the time I was done, the product team had already made the decision it was supposed to inform.

Ship an 80% analysis on time, then iterate. A good-enough answer today beats a perfect answer next month.

### Optimising for title vs learning

I turned down a senior analyst role at a small company to stay at Shopify as an analyst II, because I knew I'd learn more from the Shopify infrastructure and team. Two years later I got promoted to senior and then lateral-hired at Stripe at a higher level than the role I'd turned down.

Optimise for slope, not intercept.

## The Skills That Actually Got Me Hired

Every recruiter screen, every final round, every hiring manager I've talked to cared about:

1. **SQL proficiency** — this is table stakes at any data role. Window functions, CTEs, query optimisation.
2. **Storytelling with data** — can you explain a complex finding simply?
3. **Business intuition** — can you connect the data to a business outcome?
4. **Technical curiosity** — are you self-teaching, staying current, building things?

Python and ML were nice-to-haves that differentiated me once I was through the door. They weren't what got me in.

## Advice I'd Give My 2019 Self

- Find a senior analyst whose work you admire and ask to review your work with them monthly. Most people will say yes.
- Write up your analyses even when nobody asks. The habit of documenting decisions is worth its weight in gold.
- Develop a point of view. Analysts who only report what the data says are replaceable. Analysts who say "here's what I think we should do, and here's why" become indispensable.
- Your first company matters less than the people you learn from there.
